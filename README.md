# Myportfolio

This is my personal portfolio as a new developer. This Application presents my projects and information about me for future employers. The goal was to make it look like a magazine cover, right now it is a very sad interpretation of one but I will keep working on it.

## Table of Contents

* About me
* Projects
* Contact Information

## Technologies

This project is created with:
* Html
* Css
## Features

The ability to get me a job, doubtful, but I'm keeping hope alive.
## Project status

While demonstrative of my current amatuer abilities, this is not the final version of this application. In the future I intend to restyle to better reflect what I intended and add more features and functionality.
